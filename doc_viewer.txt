                  Finding connections between a sea of documents can be
                  challenging. By enhancing the data processing techniques
                  during the digitization of documents, Topologe aims to expand
                  search capabilities so that you can find the needle in the
                  haystack faster. Our document viewer streamlines the discovery
                  process by combining 3 tools: 1. Graphs map out documents and
                  their topics 2. Diff Viewer visually compares two documents
                  side by side 3. Semantic search exhaustively finds all matches
                  for a given topic (e.g. "aircraft" matches "plane"). With
                  broad applications across legal, administrative, and HR teams,
                  Document Viewer provides an efficient and innovative way to
                  view your data.
