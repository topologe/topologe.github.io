                  Many large agencies are responsible for handling incoming data
                  and reports daily from sources nationwide. These agencies must
                  enter and store far more data than any single analyst can
                  process in a reasonable amount of time. Such a deluge of data
                  may lead many analysts to miss critical information, leading
                  to employee burnout and low morale. Topologe created FlyBy to
                  cluster data using NLP techniques of measuring text
                  similarity, so that messages with similar words, phrases, and
                  topics can be grouped together in 3-D space. After clustering,
                  a human analyst can use the tool to inspect a cluster,
                  determine the common threads of the cluster, and process the
                  group of messages as a single entity. Once identified,
                  clusters may be packaged and sent to the relevant maintenance
                  group for further analysis. This approach takes tens of
                  thousands of messages and sorts them into a few dozen
                  clusters, reducing the processing time from
                  <b>weeks</b> to <b>hours</b> for a single analyst.

                  Cyberthreats are an ever-evolving threat to every business and
                  government organization holding sensitive information.
                  Malicious bots and malware generate very different traffic
                  patterns than most regular employees, which our ML model
                  detects and reports. By monitoring dozens of cybersecurity
                  data points, our model detects risky behavior and protects
                  valuable information from cyber threats. When viewing two
                  features at a time, analysts can visually distinguish daily
                  activity from high-risk behaviors. In addition, our models
                  promote responses to threats with confidence and Security

                  By applying lessons learned within cybersecurity threat
                  detection to 3-D space, Topologe created an adaptable version
                  of FlyBy capable of identifying malicious traffic, examining
                  patterns and trends within clusters, and triaging threats.
                  With the naked eye, analysts can assess incoming traffic,
                  easily sequester clusters of threats, and discard large
                  volumes of harmless network traffic. The more users interact
                  with FlyBy, the more the AI learns from human experts which
                  threat signals to monitor over time.

                  In the transportation industry, machine learning innovations
                  are paving the way for predictive and preventive maintenance
                  that can allow aircraft technicians to repair vehicles when
                  they require maintenance rather than on a traditional fixed
                  schedule. After measuring various health indicators in
                  aircraft engines over their life cycles, Topologe developed an
                  engine health predictor that provides technicians with a
                  health score, saving valuable diagnostic time in the hangar.
                  This preventative technology can also be applied to facilities
                  management (e.g. servers, network equipment, radars, runway
                  lights, etc).

                  Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and social media
                  mining, our Sentiment Analysis model provides a comprehensive
                  analysis of large data sets to understand attitudes. Filtering
                  the body of posts by dates, sources, and sentiment levels
                  produces a method of tracking sentiments across time and
                  social media sources to provide more insight on public
                  sentiment of a given organization across multiple categories
                  of interest. This search engine can be used to automate
                  analysis for a variety of linguistic settings, such as reviews
                  made by employees or comments left by technicians and
                  manufacturers. In addition, NLP can perform text
                  summarization, root cause analysis, detect disinformation,
                  etc.
