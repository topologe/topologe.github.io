                  Many large agencies are responsible for handling incoming data
                  and reports daily from sources nationwide. These agencies must
                  enter and store far more data than any single analyst can
                  process in a reasonable amount of time. Such a deluge of data
                  may lead many analysts to miss critical information, leading
                  to employee burnout and low morale. Topologe created FlyBy to
                  cluster data using NLP techniques of measuring text
                  similarity, so that messages with similar words, phrases, and
                  topics can be grouped together in 3-D space. After clustering,
                  a human analyst can use the tool to inspect a cluster,
                  determine the common threads of the cluster, and process the
                  group of messages as a single entity. Once identified,
                  clusters may be packaged and sent to the relevant maintenance
                  group for further analysis. This approach takes tens of
                  thousands of messages and sorts them into a few dozen
                  clusters, reducing the processing time from
                  <b>weeks</b> to <b>hours</b> for a single analyst.

                  Philippines Agricultural Consumption Evaluator (PACE)
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  In order to combat shortages in crop yields in the near
                  future, the Philippines' Department of Agriculture must
                  understand how much monthly production they can expect from
                  their farms, how much rice they must import from outside
                  markets, and what cost they will pay to meet their national
                  demand. Using a combination of time series forecasting and
                  statistical modelling, Philippines Agricultural Consumption
                  Evaluator (PACE) is a multi-use tool that pinpoints which
                  "levers" that the government can manipulate to maximize
                  production, estimates of the next 12 months of neighboring
                  competitive import prices, and an interactive chart displaying
                  cumulative rice stocks based on imports. Understanding how
                  economic taxes and fees affect crop yield help the government
                  will empower the government to maximize production, while the
                  price model will enable better ability to reduce import cost
                  by selecting cheaper time frames to import rice while keeping
                  a safe stock for citizens in case of emergency.

                  The FAA has worked for decades to enhance the safety and
                  predictability of aviation traffic in the United States. This
                  success is supported by the diligent planning and coordination
                  of aircraft movements by pilots and air traffic controllers.
                  While the rate of accidents in U.S. aviation is very low,
                  there is always room for improvement. This tool processes
                  transcripts of ATC communications with pilots to extract
                  relevant insights, identifying the actions pilots are
                  instructed to take and those they intend to take. The data
                  serves as an additional layer of validation and verification
                  to ensure that spoken instructions are accurately understood
                  by both pilots and controllers. It can also help identify
                  imminent risks, such as runway contention or in-air
                  collisions.

                  are paving the way for predictive and preventive maintenance
                  that can allow aircraft technicians to repair vehicles when
                  they require maintenance rather than on a traditional fixed

                  aircraft engines over their life cycles, Topologe developed an

                  health score, saving valuable diagnostic time in the hangar.
                  This preventative technology can also be applied to facilities
